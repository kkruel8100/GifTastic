# GifTastic

### The app uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of extreme sports.  The app calls the GIPHY API and uses Javascript an jQuery to change the HTML of the website.

#### How the app works:

1. An array of strings is used to create buttons in HTML.
2. When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.
3. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate.  If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
4. Under every gif, the rating is displayed (PG, G, etc.)
5. The app allows the user to add a new sport that will create a button at the top.
